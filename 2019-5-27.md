# First Devlog

Hello!

I am Twarit Waikar, and I am working on preparing a VCS integration for the Godot Engine and developing some GUI features for the editor.

* This repository is a collection of my worklogs during this GSoC 2019 project.

* I will attempt to keep these logs once a week. (probably adding some lines to a file every day and posting it once a week)

* Since today is the day GSoC's coding period has officially started, I will be sharing the progress I have done till now.

* This is the working repo: http://github.com/IronicallySerious/godot and in the end, a PR shall be made to the main Godot Engine repo containing all the code for the VCS integration through the `add-vcs-integration` branch.

* Currently the project is at the point of creating a soft structure of all the vertical slices that we have. 
    1. VCS interaction GUI
    2. Common VCS API for all types of VCSes out there (very crude in the start)
    3. GDNative/Source C++ based plugin for implementing the VCS API specifically for Git at first.
    
* The main structure for each of these is ready and this week I will try to finish up the GUI as discussed and move on to the Git implementation part for the API

* Mentored by: @groud and @jahd2602 from the Godot Engine organisation
